# RPA  Notes
RPA is a software technology that makes it easier for humans to manage mundane workflow processes. It stands for Robotic Process Automation.

## RPA Lifecycle

The RPA lifecyle is the structure of how automation is delivered and executed. It is the phases that a bot goes through from start to finish.

It is a framework for process automation that several phases:

* RPA Candidate Identification 
how RPA stakeholders identify business processes and tasks for
 automation. Can be used to discover candidates for task mining.

* Assessment & Prioritization
how automation candidates are assessed for design and development. For ex
ample, if a task or process requires too many decisions or uses too many
systems, it may not be a good candidate for RPA.

Also determines priority of tasks or processes for a business.
i.e. How much time is consumed? or Would automation improve quality
of output errors?

* Design 

a blueprint for the RPA developer like a *PDD* or *process 
design document*.
Defines and models the actual task or process to be automated 
and maps any dependencies that the automation process might have like the 
systems it interacts with.

* Development and Testing

The RPA developer builds the robot according to design phases' requirements and the QA team tests the automated process for testing and staging to ensure that the program executes properly.

* Deployment

The bot is deployed into production and runs as configured by the RPA tools orchestrator.

* Monitoring and Change

Final stage where the bot is continously assessed for performance and runtime errors.
