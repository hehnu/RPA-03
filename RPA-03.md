The RPA lifecyle is the structure of how automation is delivered and executed. It is the phases that a bot goes through from start to finish.

It is a framework for process automation that several phases:

* RPA Candidate Identification 

 how RPA stakeholders identify business processes and tasks for
 automation. Can be used to discover candidates for task mining.

* Assessment & Prioritization

how automation candidates are assessed for design and development. For ex
ample, if a task or process requires too many decisions or uses too many
systems, it may not be a good candidate for RPA.

Also determines priority of tasks or processes for a business.
i.e. How much time is consumed? or Would automation improve quality
of output errors?

*Design 

This phase defining and modeling the actual task or process to be automated 
and maps any dependencies that the automation process might have like the 
systems it interacts with.

Design phase is a blueprint for the RPA developer like a *PDD* or *process 
design document*.
