# RPA  Notes

+ RPA stands for Robotic Process Automation.
+ It is software technology that makes it easy to build, deploy, and manage software robots that emulate human's actions interacting with digital systems and software. 
+ These robots can do a wide range of things in a faster much consistent manner than humans. Examples of such activities are: recognizing complete keystrokes, navigating systems, and extracting data. 

## RPA Lifecycle

![](https://intellipaat.com/mediaFiles/2019/04/Life-Cycle-of-RPA.png)

The RPA lifecyle is the structure of how automation is delivered and executed. It is the phases that a bot goes through from start to finish.

### It is a framework for process automation that several phases:

1. RPA Candidate Identification 
* how RPA stakeholders identify business processes and tasks for automation. Can be used to discover candidates for task mining.

2. Assessment & Prioritization 

* how automation candidates are assessed for design and development. For example, if a task or process requires too many decisions or uses too many systems, it may not be a good candidate for RPA.

* Also determines priority of tasks or processes for a business. i.e. How much time is consumed? or Would automation improve quality of output errors?

3. Design 

* a blueprint for the RPA developer through **PDD** or **process design document**.
* Defines and models the actual task or process to be automated and maps any dependencies that the automation process might have like the systems it interacts with.

4. Development and Testing

* The RPA developer builds the robot according to design phases' requirements and the QA team tests the automated process for testing and staging to ensure that the program executes properly.

5. Deployment

* The bot is deployed into production and runs as configured by the RPA tools orchestrator.

6. Monitoring and Change

* Final stage where the bot is continously assessed for performance and runtime errors.
